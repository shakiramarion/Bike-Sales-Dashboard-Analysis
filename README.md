# Bike-Sales-Dashboard-Analysis
## Problem Statement
The project aims to analyze the factors influencing bike purchasing decisions among various demographic groups. Despite the growing popularity of biking as a mode of transportation and recreation, there is limited understanding of the characteristics that drive individuals to purchase bikes. This study seeks to identify key demographic attributes such as marital status, income, education, and commute distance that correlate with bike purchases. By examining these factors, we can provide insights that may assist manufacturers and retailers in targeting their marketing strategies effectively.

## Project Objective
To analyze the demographic and socioeconomic factors that influence bike purchasing decisions among consumers, with the aim of identifying key characteristics that can inform targeted marketing strategies for bike manufacturers and retailers.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/shakiramarion/Bike-Sales-Dashboard-Analysis/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx">Bike Sales Dataset</a>

## Research Questions
- What demographic factors (age, gender, marital status, income) are most strongly associated with bike purchasing decisions among consumers?
- How does the level of education influence the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
- How does commute distance impact the decision to purchase a bike?
- Are there significant regional differences in bike purchasing behavior among consumers?
- What are the primary motivations for consumers who decide to purchase a bike compared to those who do not?

## Steps Followed
- Load the data into Excel.
- Cleaned the data by handling missing and null values and removing duplicates.
- Performed Analysis.
- Answered the Research Questions.
- Performed Visualizations using Excel.
- Prepared an interactive Excel Dashboard from the visualizations and included slicers with connections to the relevant visuals.

## Project Insights
- Younger individuals (ages 30-40) are more likely to purchase bikes compared to older demographics. Additionally, males show a higher propensity for bike purchases than femaless.
- Higher income groups tend to purchase bikes more frequently, suggesting that financial capability plays a significant role in the decision-making process.
- Single individuals are more likely to buy bikes compared to married individuals. Furthermore, those with fewer children tend to show higher purchasing rates, indicating that family obligations may limit bike ownership.
- Individuals with higher education levels (Bachelor's degree or above) are more inclined to purchase bikes. Occupation also matters; professionals are more likely to buy bikes than those in manual or clerical jobs.
- A significant correlation exists between shorter commute distances (0-1 miles) and bike purchases. Consumers who live closer to their workplaces are more likely to opt for biking as a commuting option.
- There are noticeable differences in bike purchasing behavior across regions, with consumers in the Pacific region showing a higher tendency to purchase bikes compared to those in Europe.

## Conclusions
-  Manufacturers and retailers should tailor their marketing strategies based on demographic insights. For instance, campaigns targeting younger, single individuals with higher incomes could be more effective.
-  Understanding the preferences of different demographic segments can guide product development, ensuring offerings align with consumer needs and lifestyles.
-  Promotional activities should emphasize the benefits of biking for short commutes, particularly in urban areas where distances are minimal.
-  Additional research could explore the motivations behind bike purchases in greater depth, such as lifestyle choices or environmental concerns, which were not explicitly captured in the dataset.
