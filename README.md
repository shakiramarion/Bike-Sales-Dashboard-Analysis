# Bike-Sales-Dashboard-Analysis
## Problem Statement
The project aims to analyze the factors influencing bike purchasing decisions among various demographic groups. Despite the growing popularity of biking as a mode of transportation and recreation, there is limited understanding of the characteristics that drive individuals to purchase bikes. This study seeks to identify key demographic attributes such as marital status, income, education, and commute distance that correlate with bike purchases. By examining these factors, we can provide insights that may assist manufacturers and retailers in targeting their marketing strategies effectively.
